    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        These oven-roasted potatoes are very easy to make, so you can have a delicious side dish with minimal work!
    </p>
    <p>You can use dried herbs but if you have fresh on hand, by all means, use them! I find the high temperature can cause fresh garlic to burn so roasted potatoes is one of the only places I really like to use garlic powder in place of fresh.</p>
    <p>Feel free to be creative with the seasonings on these easy oven potatoes, they go great with pretty much anything!</p>
